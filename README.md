# website-resources

This application is a tool which downloads websites and stores them in db.

Documentation of application API is defined in api-specification/website-api.yaml.
Copy content of the file and paste into Swagger Editor: https://editor.swagger.io.

Contract of API layer of application (controllers interfaces and dto models) is automatically generated by Open API 
tools, so compile project before you run it.

Downloading websites is a job triggered by send message to a queue. To have working queue run Kafka on port defined in 
kafka.bootstrapAddress property. Also create kafka topics with names taken from KafkaTopic constants.

Cache for temporary stored urls (while website is being downloaded) needs to have Hazelcast running.

**Project Roadmap**
 - add integration tests
 - add security
 - add profiles to differ production and developer db configuration
 - decoupling application into 2 separate microservices
